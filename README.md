---

## This app is a programming task, it is divided into 3 tasks.

**Task 1:**
Please send us a web project using any framework, connecting to and using this public
REST-api ( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ), displaying POSTS (with pagination, 20 per page) and for each post a
list of COMMENTS. You can find endpoints to the POSTS and COMMENTS on the homepage of the REST-api.

**Task 2:**
solve this task: given an integer 335, write a method sumOfDigits(integer) that returns the sum of the digits of a given
integer. For the above, the result would be 11. Send us the code for a method that does this.

**Task 3:**
Please send us a small web-app that contains an input field, where the user may only enter a valid
email-address ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Validation_and_verification
Once it is valid, display a green check-mark from ionicons next to the input field ( http://ionicons.com/ ) and display
4 rows of output below the input. This output changes dynamically when the user makes changes in the input field. Here
are the rules for the output:

- 1 the entire email address is displayed
- 2 only the first part (before the @) of the email address is displayed
- 3 the second part of the email address is displayed
- 4 a mailto link is dynamically created and displayed, with a custom subject line saying â€œThat was an easy Task,
  Systaro!"
